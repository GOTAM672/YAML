## Introduction
YAML stands for **yaml ain't markup language**. It is data format used to exchange data. Similar to **XML** and **JSON**. In YAML, we can store only data and not commands.<br>
**Usage :- **<br>
- [configuration files]
- [logs]

## Data Serialisation

**Data serialisation** is the process of converting data to a format that could be easily stored or sent over network. Or It is process of converting data object which is combination code and data into series of bytes that saves the state of this object in a form that is easily transmittable. Reverse pf this process is called **Data de-serialisation**.<br>
Some of Data Serialisation languages are - YAML, JASON and XML.
